                <p class = "indented-paragraph"> Hi, I'm Johnny. I am a sophmore at Ohio State University majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, with a planned minor 
                    in Business Analytics. I am passionate about <strong>software development, math, and data analysis</strong>.

                <p class = "indented-paragraph">
                      I took my first CS class my sophomore year of high school
                        and have worked to further develop my skills ever since. I enjoy 
                        utilizing my programming skills along with my creativity to create 
                        useful and fun applications. I have also had an innate, lifelong 
                        passion in baseball analytics. I combined this interest with math and statistics to develop
                        a player projection model using Python.

                        This summer, I was employed as a software engineer intern at Redwood
                        Logistics. I worked in an agile enviroment on a logistics platform sold
                        as a service. I specifically worked on a database reduction project to limit
                        storage and costs on AWS.
